<h1>Recipe of pancakes</h1>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<h3>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, oil, and
    egg. Mix until smooth.</h3>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<h5>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using
    approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook
    until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</h5>
